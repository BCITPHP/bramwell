["ConditionAnalysis"]=> "We noted minor alligatoring. We recommend that pavement be monitored for ravelling or cracking and that preventative maintenance be followed that ensure proper drainage of the surface before sealing."

["PhysicalCondition"]=> "This component refers to the asphalt vehicular roadway and surface parking. Resurfacing refers to the removal and re-instatement of the top coat once deterioration no longer benefits from sealant application. A few base-coat structural repairs and the resetting of one storm drainage drain or grille are typically included in a resurfacing major repair."
